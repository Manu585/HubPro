# Contributing to Minecraft Hub Plugin

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Minecraft Hub Plugin! This document provides guidelines and instructions on how to contribute to this project. We value your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, please ensure you have a GitHub account and are familiar with basic Git commands and GitHub workflows. If you are new to Git or GitHub, you might want to check out [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart).

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the project for you to work on.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username. `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/HubPro.git`
4. **Set Upstream**: Navigate to the repository directory on your computer and add the original repository as an upstream remote. This allows you to keep your fork up-to-date with the main project.
`cd HubPro`
`git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/HubPro.git`

### Step 2: Find Something to Work On

Feel free to take on anything that interests you! If you are looking for a place to start, you can look at the current issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These are great for first-time contributors.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your work. This keeps your changes organized and separate from the main branch.
`git checkout -b your-branch-name`
2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes, add new features, or fix bugs. Make sure your code adheres to the existing code style and structure.
3. **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting your changes, test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected within the plugin's infrastructure.
4. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them.
`git commit -am "Add a brief description of your changes"`

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Pull the Latest Version of Main**: Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main project branch.
`git pull upstream main`

2. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork.
`git push origin your-branch-name`

3. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your fork on GitHub and click `New pull request`. Select your branch and ensure it is compared to the correct base branch in the original repository.
4. **Describe Your Changes**: Provide a detailed description of what your changes do and why they should be included in the plugin. Link any relevant issues.

## Review Process

Once you submit your pull request, I will review your changes. The review process may take some time, depending on the complexity and size of the changes. I may suggest some modifications or improvements to better integrate with the plugin's infrastructure.

## After Your Pull Request is Merged

Once your pull request is approved and merged, your contributions will be part of the HubPro Plugin. Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!
